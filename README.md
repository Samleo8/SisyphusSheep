## FAQ
### Why is this game called Sisyphus Sheep?
According to Greek legend, Sisyphus was a cruel Greek king who was punished to push a large rock up a hill, only to have it roll back down; he would do this futile task endlessly for eternity. 


Similarly, in this game, an innocent sheep is made to run towards a meaningless goal, avoid random obstacles, and repeat this meaningless goal. 


The game is meant to point you towards the meaninglessness of life. Find, treasure and do the things that actually matter, and consider storing up a treasure for eternity through Jesus Christ (*insert sheep reference here*). 

### What inspired you to make this game?

The game was originally called **Treadmill Torment** for a reason: I was running on a treadmill (I hate running) and thought, "Why not make a game out of this?". It was later renamed Sisyphus Sheep for the reason [detailed  above](#why-is-this-game-called-sisyphus-sheep).
